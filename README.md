I utilized my expertise in database management, data cleaning, and data visualization to complete a sales insights data analysis project for a computer hardware business. Using Tableau and Power BI, I created a comprehensive dashboard showcasing visualizations for total revenue, sales quantity, top customers, top products, and revenue by year with filters. I created a database in MS SQL, cleaned millions of transaction records using Python, and performed data cleaning and analysis in SQL using techniques like COALESCE. This project highlighted my ability to solve complex business problems using data-driven solutions and demonstrated my proficiency in various technical tools and methods.
