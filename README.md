I completed a sales insights data analysis project for a computer hardware business facing challenges in a dynamically changing market. 
Using my expertise in database management, data cleaning, and data visualization, I created a comprehensive dashboard with Tableau that included visualizations for total revenue, 
sales quantity, top five customers, top five products, and revenue by year, with filters by year and month.

To accomplish this project, I first created a database in MS SQL and loaded the raw data into tables. I then used my skills in Python to clean millions of transaction records
before loading the cleaned data into MS SQL. Once the data was clean and organized, I performed additional data cleaning and analysis in SQL using techniques like COALESCE and 
updated the tables accordingly.

This project required a wide range of technical skills, including expertise in Python, SQL, and Tableau, as well as the ability to provide actionable insights and recommendations
based on the analysis. Overall, this project showcased my ability to use data-driven solutions to solve complex business problems, and demonstrated my expertise in a variety of
technical tools and methods.
